# About

My name is Jesus Vico, a Telecommunications Engineer interested in the use of cryptography to develop trustless systems. Because of this, I am trying to study every technology that helps us to develop them: peer-to-peer networks, blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, trapdoor functions, and etcetera.
